# Python_projects
Collection of python projects used for practising/improving python skills. 

* Fetal Health Project 

This project involves inspecting the fetal health dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification), exploring which features may be relevant for best detecting whether fetal health will be normal, suspect, or pathological. Using all of the features in the dataset, I compare three models for the classification of fetal health:
- Random Forest
- KNN
- SVM








# Other notebooks: 


* RDM_figures 

Notebook I made for creating matrix plots depicting "representational dissimilarity matrices" used in representational similarity analysis. To see the plots in context, visit https://eliseetal.github.io/RSA-blog-post.html
