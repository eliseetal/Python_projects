# Python_projects
Collection of python projects used for practising/improving python skills. 

* Fetal Health Project 

This project involves inspecting the fetal health dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification), exploring which features may be relevant for best detecting whether fetal health will be normal, suspect, or pathological. Using all of the features in the dataset, I compare three models for the classification of fetal health:
- Random Forest
- KNN
- SVM


* Flaredown exploratory data analysis (EDA)

I wanted to do this project as practice for working with data that may not necessarily be nicely defined, or one that doesn't have a clear path on how to explore the analyse the data. In research, I am used to defining the research question, designing and programming the tasks, collecting the data that I know I will need to answer the research question(s) at hand. However, when working for a company, I may be presented with some pre-existing data and need to gather insights about a particular research question. 

Â This project is practice for this type of scenario.

* RDM_figures 

Notebook I made for creating matrix plots depicting "representational dissimilarity matrices" used in representational similarity analysis. To see the plots in context, visit https://eliseetal.github.io/RSA-blog-post.html
